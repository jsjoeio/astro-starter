# astro-starter

## [Demo Site](https://jsjoeio-astro-starter.netlify.app/)

If you couldn't tell from the GitHub repo page, this starter is built off another starter called [`astro-minimal-starter`](https://github.com/jaydanurwin/astro-minimal-starter).

I decided to make my own starter because I wanted to make a couple changes to the base template. These are the changes I've made:

- minor SEO adjustments
- store post/page data in `src/data/posts`
- add Netlify CMS
- add Netlify Redirects

## Get Started

# Install Dependencies

```shell
yarn
```

# Run Site locally

```shell
yarn start
```

# Build Site

```shell
yarn build
```

Navigate to `src/data/site.js` and edit to match your site's information.

Start writing new blog posts in Markdown at `src/data/posts/`.
